## 写法一：“原因分析 + 解决方案”
题目中出现两个问题：What are the reasons? What can be done to ... ?

## 文体结构

    1. Introduction: 改写题目，给出预告
    2. Body Paragraph 1: 问题1
    3. Body Paragraph 2: 问题2
    4. Conclusion: 总结，重复

##  For example 
> **Task 2: A lot of young people do not know how to manage their money when graduating from high school. What do you think are the reasons? What can be done to teach them this important skill?**


问题1: **你认为原因是什么？**

问题2: **能做什么来帮助他们学会这重要的技能？**


*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出预告：缺少知识是因为缺少生活经验以及有限的教育，这能够被两个简单的方法解决。
   Many young people are leaving school without a basic and vital understanding of how personal finances ought to be managed in the adult world. This lack of knowledge is due to a lack of life experience and limited education which can be solved in two simple ways. 


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：原因一是他们和父母免费地住在一起。另外一个原因是学校未把个人财产范围纳入课程范围。
   **One main reason why so many young people are unable to manage their own finances upon finishing high school is that they have been living along with their parents for free.** As a result, they have never needed to earn a salary or save their money in order to pay bills. **Another cause is that schools do not factor personal financial management into their curriculum.** Schools focus instead on classic subjects, such as maths, geography, history and languages, which means important life skills are not being taught. Both teachers and parents are failing to prepare young people for the real world. 


*  ### Body Paragraph 2：有两个方法来解决年轻人无法管理个人财产。
   There are two options for solving young people's inability to manage personal finances. 


*  ### Conclusion：总结，重复：年轻人缺少财产管理技能是因为家长和学校的疏忽，这可以被解决如果这两者能够肩负起为毕业生装备这合适的技能肩负起更多的责任的话。
   In conclusion, young people lack financial management skills due to the negligence of parents and schools, which can only be solved if both take more responsibility for equipping school leavers with the right skills. 


## 写法二：“原因 + 有何影响”
题目出现两个问题：What are the reasons? Do you think it is a positive or a negative development?

## 文体结构

    1. Introduction: 改写题目，给出预告
    2. Body Paragraph 1: 问题1
    3. Body Paragraph 2: 问题2
    4. Conclusion: 总结，重复

## For example
> **Task 2: These days more fathers stay at home and take care of their children while mothers go out to work. What could be the reasons for this? Do you think it is a positive or a negative development?**


问题1: **你认为原因是什么？**

问题2: **你认为这是一个积极的还是消极的发展？**


*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出预告：这会有几个原因，同时我认识这是一个积极的趋势。
   It is true that men are increasingly likely to take on the role of househusband, while more women than ever are the breadwinners in their families. There could be several reasons for this, and I consider it to be a very positive trend.


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：原因一平权运动获得了进展，女性获得资质从事职业变得常见。另外一个原因是生活成本的上涨意味着夫妻双方常常都需要工作存钱在组建家庭之前。
	In recent years, parents have had to adapt to various changes in our societies. **Equal rights movements have made great progress, and it has become normal for women to gain qualifications and pursue a career.** It has also become socially acceptable for men to stay at home and look after their children. **At the same time, the rising cost of living has meant that both marriage partners usually need to work and save money before starting a family.** Therefore, when couples have children, they may decide who works and who stays at home depending on the personal preference of each partner, or based on which partner earns the most money.
   

*  ### Body Paragraph 2：在我看来，上述的变化应当被视作进步。
	In my view, the changes described above should be seen as progress. We should be happy to live in a society in which men and women have equal opportunities, and in which women are not put under pressure to sacrifice their careers. Equally, it seems only fair that men should be free to leave their jobs in order to assume childcare responsibilities if this is what they wish to do. Couples should be left to make their own decisions about which parental role each partner takes, according to their particular circumstances and needs. 


*  ### Conclusion：总结，重复：男性女性在家庭中的角色转变是社会变化的结果，我认为这些发展是合理的。
	In conclusion, the changing roles of men and women in the family are a result of wider changes in society, and I believe that these developments are desirable.

*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出预告：音乐是人类文化的重要一部分是有一些原因的，同时我认为传统音乐比现代的国际音乐更加重要。
