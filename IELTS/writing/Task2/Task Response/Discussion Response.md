通过题目的最后一句话 “Discuss both views and give you own opinion.” 我们可以确定题型为Discuss，讨论这两个观点并给出你自己的观点。

注意：Discuss题型要求**平衡地**论证题目给出的两个观点，核心段字数要**大致相同**。

## 写法一：“Both 两者都”

**当我们遇到题目给出的两个观点都想同意时，个人观点就可以为两者都同意。因此称这种写法为“Both 两者都”。**
## 文体结构

    1. Introduction: 改写题目，给出个人观点预告
    2. Body Paragraph 1: 观点1
    3. Body Paragraph 2: 观点2
    4. Conclusion: 总结，个人观点：两者缺一不可

## For example
> **Task 2: Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.**


观点1: 一些人认为**博物馆应当是愉快的地方使人们娱乐**。

观点2: 另一些人认为**博物馆的目的是教育**。


*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出个人观点预告：在我看来，博物馆应当既有娱乐又有教育。
    People have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：一方面，博物馆的主要角色是娱乐。
    On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain.  


*  ### Body Paragraph 2：另一方面，一些人认为博物馆应当聚焦于教育。
    On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education.  


*  ### Conclusion：总结，给出个人观点：一个好的博物馆硬刚提供一个有趣的，享受的以及有教育意义的体验以便人们可以在玩的时候也能学到东西。
    In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.

## 写法二：“弱强”

**当我们遇到题目给出的两个观点仅支持其中一方。**
## 文体结构

    1. Introduction: 改写题目，给出个人观点预告
    2. Body Paragraph 1: 弱
    3. Body Paragraph 2: 强
    4. Conclusion: 总结，个人观点：弱化弱，强化强

## For example
> **Task 2: Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.**


观点1: 一些人认为**政府应当花费公共资金来保护这些语言**。

观点2: 另一些人认为**这是浪费钱**。

注意：题目中的第一句话"Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. 一些语言处于灭绝的危险中，因为有他们被很少的人说。" 这句话为既定事实，为**背景句**。


*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出个人观点预告：虽然政府可以通过允许这样的事发生来节省钱，但我认为这些语言可以被保护。
    It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：有一些原因可能解释为什么保护少数语言会被视作浪费钱。
    There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. 


*  ### Body Paragraph 2：尽管有上述论述，我认为政府应当尝试保护被少数使用的语言。
    Despite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken.


*  ### Conclusion：总结，给出个人观点：短期来看这可能会省钱如果我们允许小众语言消失，但长期来看这会对我们的文化遗产有相当消极的影响。
    In conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage. 
    
    
## 写法三：“取决于”

**当我们对于题目给出的两个观点有自己的其他看法（具体情况具体分析）。**

## 文体结构

    1. Introduction: 改写题目，给出个人观点预告
    2. Body Paragraph 1: 观点1
    3. Body Paragraph 2: 观点2
    4. Body Paragraph 3: 自己的看法：取决于
    5. Conclusion: 总结，重复个人观点


## For example
> **Task 2: Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.**


观点1: 一些人认为**完成大学教育是找到一个好工作的最好方法**。

观点2: 另一些人认为**积累经验，发展软技能更加重要**。


*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出个人观点预告：对于学术职位来说，有大学教育是重要的。但软技能和经验在商业中是更加有用的。
    It is considered by some that being a university graduate is the key to securing a good job, while there are others who think that it is better to have experience and soft skills. In my opinion, I believe that having university education is essential for academic jobs while soft skills and experience are more useful in business. 


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：一方面，很多人认为对于大多数人找到一个好工作是更容易的，如果他们是有一个好的学位的大学毕业生。
    On the one hand, many think it is easier for most people to find a good job if they are university graduates with a good degree.


*  ### Body Paragraph 2：另一方面，根据一些人的看法，拥有工作经验和软技能，例如领导能力和其他人际交往能力，也可以使申请人处于有利地位。
    On the other hand, having work experience and soft skills, such as leadership skills and other interpersonal skills, can also throw the balance in favour of the applicant, according to some.
    
    
*  ### Body Paragraph 3：最后，在我看来，是否需要高水平教育或技能和经验，取决于申请的职位。
    Finally, in my opinion, whether needing high level education or skills and experience, depends on the position being applied for. 


*  ### Conclusion：总结，给出个人观点：要想获得一份好工作，需要有相关的经验或教育背景，具体取决于工作类型和领域。人们应该确保在申请工作之前获得必要的技能或学位，以确保成功。
    In conclusion, getting a good job requires a relevant background either in experience or education depending on the type of work and field. People should make sure they attain the necessary skills or degrees before applying for a job in order to be sure of success.
