通过题目的最后一句话 “To what extent do you agree or disagree?” 我们可以确定题型为是否赞同，在什么程度上你同意或不同意。
<font color="red">注意：是否题型是你自己的观点，不需要别人怎么认为。</font>

## 写法一：“完全同意”

**在审题之后发现自己的观点跟题目完全一致，完全无法反驳，那么就可以写成完全同意。**

## 文体结构

    1. Introduction: 改写题目，给出个人观点预告 —— 完全同意
    2. Body Paragraph 1: 同意理由1
    3. Body Paragraph 2: 同意理由2
    4. Conclusion: 总结，个人观点：我完全同意题目中的观点

## For example
> **Task 2: Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**


* ### Introduction：改写题目，给出个人观点预告：我完全同意允许这样的人来告诉青少年他们的经验是最好的方法来组织他们违反法律。
	It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.


* ### Body Paragraph 1：在我看来，青少年更愿意接受那些以自己经历出发的人的建议。
	In my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience.


* ### Body Paragraph 2：用改过自新的罪犯来教育青少年关于犯罪的做法会更加有效。
	The alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much more effective.


* ### Conclusion：总结，给出个人观点：我完全同意在服刑改过自新之后的人能够阻止青少年犯罪。
    In conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.

## 写法二：“完全不同意”

**在审题之后发现自己的观点跟题目完全不同，那么就可以写成完全不同意。但要注意，可能会出现没有观点，根本怼不动。**

> **Task 2:  Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?**

*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出个人观点预告：个人而言，我完全不同意这个观点。
    Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally, I completely disagree with this view.


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：有一些原因能够解释为那些为私立教育付费的家庭减少税务是错误的。
    For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to reduce taxes for families who pay for private education.


*  ### Body Paragraph 2：在我看来，我们应当乐于付一些支持公立学校的钱。

    2. Body Paragraph 1: 同意的部分

## For example
> **Task 2:  The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?**

*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出个人观点预告：虽然我认为一部分的传统观念是过时了的，但是我认为其他传统观念是仍然有用的，不应当被遗忘。
    It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：一方面，老年人拥有的关于生活的很多观念正在变得对年轻人不相关。
    On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people.


*  ### Body Paragraph 2：另一方面，一些传统观念和价值观仍然对当代世界适用。
    On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world.


*  ### Conclusion：总结，给出个人观点：虽然老年人的观点在当代世界有时似乎没有帮助，但我们不应当把所有的传统观念视作无关的东西。
    In conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.

*  ### Introduction：改写题目，给出个人观点预告：在我看来，一个老建筑是否应当被拆除，为新建筑让路取决于它就艺术和历史方面的价值。
    Most governments are faced with the dilemma of whether to spend a huge amount of money protecting old buildings or simply knock them down. In my opinion, whether an old building should be torn down and make way for a new one mainly depends on its value in terms of art and history.  


*  ### Body Paragraph 1：一方面，对政府而言投资钱和其他资源到保护一些无价值的老建筑是不明智的，尽管它存在了很久。
    On the one hand, it is not wise for the government to invest financial and other resources in protecting some valueless old buildings in spite of their centurial existence.


*  ### Body Paragraph 2：另一方面，保护有历史和艺术意义的老建筑是毫无疑问值得的，即使花大价钱。
    On the other hand, it is undoubtedly worthwhile to preserve buildings with historic and artistic meanings even at a significant cost. 

*  ### Conclusion：总结，重复个人观点：我不同意所有的老建筑都被拆除不考虑他独特的意义考虑在内。文化和历史价值的老建筑是值得被保护的。
    In conclusion, I do not agree that all old buildings should be demolished without taking their unique meanings into consideration. Culturally and historically valuable old architectural works are worth preserving and protecting.
