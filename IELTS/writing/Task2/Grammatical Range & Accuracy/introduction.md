## 介绍段的任务
首先明确，介绍段只是一个功能段，不需要复杂的内容。
## 可能的结构

    1. 背景改写 + 题目观点改写 + 个人观点
    2. 题目观点改写 + 个人观点
    3. 背景改写 + 个人观点 （不建议使用）


## For example
### **写法一： 背景改写 + 题目观点改写 + 个人观点**
---
### 是否赞同题型
> **Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

题目第一句话 `Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, 野生动物在21实际没有生存空间` 可以看作为背景句，为后面的观点句做铺垫 `so protecting them is a waste of resources. 所以保护它们是浪费资源` 。

针对 `背景句` 和 `观点句` 分别进行改写。

> **Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them.**

完成改写后，直接针对 `观点句` 给出 `个人观点` 。

> Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. **I completely disagree with this point of view.**

---
## **写法二： 题目观点改写 + 个人观点**
---
### Discussion题型
> **Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.**

题目直接给出了两个观点，于是先对这两个观点进行改写。题目中的这两个观点是针对 `应当鼓励孩子竞争还是合作` 这件事。于是可以使用 `People have different views about...`这样的句型对题目观点进行改写。

> **People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operate.**

观点改写完成后，紧跟 `个人观点` 即可。

> People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operate. **While a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, I believe that the ability to co-operate is more important.**


---

### Report题型
> **In many countries, schools have severe problems with student behavior. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?**

很简单，题目就一句话 `In many countries, schools have severe problems with student behavior. 在很多国家，学校在学生行为方面存在严重问题。` 针对这句话进行改写。

> **It is true that the behavior of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent years.**

改写完成后，针对Report题目提出的 `两个问题` 分别进行 `预告` 即可。

> It is true that the behavior of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent years. **There are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can definitely be taken to tackle the problem.**

---
### 是否赞同题型
> **As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

题目就一句话 `As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. 除了赚钱，企业也有社会责任。` 针对题目这句话进行改写。

> **Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have.**

改写完成后，直接给出 `个人观点` 。

> Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. **I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.**
---
### Positive or Negative

> **In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?**

对 `In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past.` 改写后，直接给出 `个人观点` 。

> In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. **In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.**
